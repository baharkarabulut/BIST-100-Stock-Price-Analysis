# BIST 100 Stock Price Analysis

This project analyzes the stock price data of selected BIST 100 companies using historical market data from Yahoo Finance. It utilizes Python libraries such as `yfinance`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` within a Jupyter Notebook to visualize stock closing prices, compute moving averages, and perform basic profit/loss analysis based on custom buy and sell dates.

## Features

- Download and process historical stock data for BIST-listed companies.
- Visualize closing prices along with 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages.
- Calculate potential profit or loss from hypothetical trading scenarios.
- Support for single and multiple stock comparisons with combined plots.

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook cells step-by-step to:

1. Load and preprocess stock data.
2. Visualize price trends and moving averages.
3. Perform profit/loss calculations for given buy/sell dates and quantities.
4. Compare multiple stocks visually and analytically.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- yfinance
- pandas
